##### Voting. There is a set of authorised entities (e.g. people, device, organization) to take part into collective decisions making.  People go to trusted location and anonymously vote. Then ballot sent to centralised party. 
    - Permissioned (confidential contracts, private transactions) distributed leger (blockchain): vote using private digital voting token which is linked to identification during registering to vote.
        Information is stored into immutable blockchain (e.g. AWS managed blockchain or Hyperledger Fabric)

##### Direct transactions without central athority - money (cash is anonymous)
    -  Permissionless (open) Distributed leger with a token (e.g. ETH or EOS blockchain) - cryptocurrency

##### Supply chain
    - blockchain

##### Disput resolution 
    - blockchain

##### Sharing of immutable and verifiable information between untrusted parties (between multiple different organizations)
    - blockchain
    
##### Bidding    
    - blockchain 

##### Flexible, Scalable, High-performance storage of data: 
    -  NoSQL databases (Key-value, Document, Graph, FTSearch)
    
##### Session store - A session-oriented application such as a web application starts a session when a user logs in and is active until the user logs out or the session times out.
    - key-value (DynamoDB, Cassandra) 

##### Shopping cart - During the holiday shopping season, an e-commerce website may receive billions of orders in seconds.
    - key-value (DynamoDB, Cassandra) 
            
##### Content management -  A document database is a great choice for content management applications such as blogs and video platforms. With a document database, each entity that the application tracks can be stored as a single document.
    - document databases (MongoDB)

##### Catalogs - Document databases are efficient and effective for storing catalog information. For example, in an e-commerce application, different products usually have different numbers of attributes. Managing thousands of attributes in relational databases is inefficient, and the reading performance is affected. U
    - document databases (Couchbase)
    
##### Real-time bidding - Real-time bidding refers to the buying and selling of online ad impressions.
    - in-memory database (Redis, Memcached)

##### Caching - A cache is a high-speed data storage layer which stores a subset of data, typically transient in nature, so that future requests for that data are served up faster than is possible by accessing the dataâ€™s primary storage location.
    - in-memory database (Redis, Memcached)

##### Gaming leaderboard - A relative gaming leaderboard shows a gamer's position relative to other players of a similar rank. 
    - in-memory database (Redis, Memcached)
    
##### Recommendation engines - Graph databases are a good choice for recommendation applications. 
    - graph database (Amazon Neptune, Neo4j, Ontotext graphdb) 
    
##### Fraud detection
    - graph database (Amazon Neptune, Neo4j, Ontotext graphdb) 
    
##### Text search - Search-engine databases can handle full-text search faster than relational databases. For example, an e-commerce website can use search-engine databases to provide instant autocompletes or suggestions for its customers.
    - search-engine database (Elasticsearch Service, Splunk)
    
##### Logging and analysis - Maintaining larger applications that are either distributed across several nodes or consist of several smaller applications searching for events in log files can become tedious. Search-engine databases can handle the logging more efficiently.
